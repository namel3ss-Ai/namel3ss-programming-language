# Deployment artefacts for Simple Test

This folder is generated by Namel3ss to provide production-ready starting points:

- `Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore` support container builds with Gunicorn + Uvicorn workers.
- `deploy/nginx.conf` and `deploy/Caddyfile` show how to terminate TLS and forward /api + /ws traffic.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is a GitHub Actions template that runs pytest and optionally builds/pushes an image.
- `deploy/terraform` contains a lightweight Kubernetes deployment using the official provider.
- `deploy/helm` packages the same manifests into a Helm chart for more flexible rollouts.
- `deploy/env.example` lists the environment variables referenced in this app so you can template them in CI.

These artefacts are templates—review them carefully and adapt to your infrastructure (cloud, secrets manager,
image registry, etc.).
