# Release and PyPI publishing workflow for Namel3ss
# Triggered by creating a version tag (e.g., v0.7.0)
# Requires PYPI_API_TOKEN secret to be configured in repository settings
# 
# To create a release:
# 1. Update version in pyproject.toml or setup.py
# 2. Create and push a tag: git tag v0.7.0 && git push origin v0.7.0
# 3. This workflow will build and publish to PyPI automatically
