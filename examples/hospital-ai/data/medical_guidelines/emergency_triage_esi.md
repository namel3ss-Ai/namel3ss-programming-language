**Authority**: Emergency Nurses Association (ENA)  
**Evidence Level**: A  
**Last Updated**: 2024-01-15  
**Category**: Triage  
**Specialty**: Emergency Medicine

## Emergency Severity Index (ESI) - Level 1

### Definition
Patients requiring **immediate, life-saving intervention**.

### Criteria

**Life-Threatening Conditions:**
- Cardiac arrest
- Severe respiratory distress with impending failure
- Unresponsive or rapidly declining mental status (GCS ≤ 8)
- Severe trauma with hemodynamic instability
- Actively seizing (status epilepticus)

**Vital Sign Indicators:**
- SpO2 < 90% despite oxygen
- Systolic BP < 70 mmHg in adults
- HR > 180 bpm with altered mental status
- Respiratory rate > 35 or < 10 with distress

### Immediate Actions
1. Activate emergency response team
2. Move immediately to resuscitation bay
3. Simultaneous assessment and intervention
4. Call for physician immediately

## ESI Level 2 - High Risk Situations

### Definition
Patients who **should not wait** but are not immediately life-threatening.

### High-Risk Red Flags

**Neurological:**
- New onset altered mental status or confusion
- Sudden severe headache ("worst headache of life")
- Focal neurological deficits (stroke symptoms)
- Severe head injury

**Cardiovascular:**
- Chest pain with concerning features:
  - Radiation to jaw/arm
  - Associated diaphoresis, nausea
  - Age > 35 with cardiac risk factors
  - Known CAD history
- Symptomatic arrhythmia

**Respiratory:**
- Severe asthma exacerbation
- SpO2 < 92% on room air
- Significant respiratory distress
- History of COPD with acute worsening

**Gastrointestinal:**
- Active GI bleeding (hematemesis, melena)
- Severe abdominal pain with peritoneal signs
- Suspected appendicitis

**Other:**
- Severe pain (8-10/10) with concerning etiology
- Significant traumatic injury
- Pregnancy > 20 weeks with complications

### Expected Wait Time
Less than 10 minutes

---

## ESI Level 3 - Urgent

### Definition
Patients requiring **multiple resources** but stable enough to wait briefly.

### Examples
- Moderate asthma attack
- Abdominal pain requiring CT and labs
- Chest pain in low-risk patient
- Fever with immunosuppression
- Minor trauma requiring sutures and X-ray

### Resource Requirements
Two or more of:
- Laboratory tests
- Radiological imaging (X-ray, CT, US)
- IV medications
- Procedures (suturing, reduction)
- Specialty consultation

### Expected Wait Time
30-60 minutes acceptable

---

## ESI Level 4 - Less Urgent

### Definition
Stable patients requiring **one resource**.

### Examples
- Simple laceration (sutures only)
- Minor injury (X-ray only)
- UTI symptoms (urinalysis only)
- Prescription refill
- Rash

### Expected Wait Time
1-2 hours acceptable

---

## ESI Level 5 - Non-Urgent

### Definition
Patients requiring **no resources** or clinic-appropriate care.

### Examples
- Medication refill
- Chronic condition without acute change
- Minor wound check
- Blood pressure check
- Can wait or be referred to clinic

### Expected Wait Time
2+ hours acceptable or refer to clinic

## Age-Specific Considerations

### Pediatric Modifications

**Vital Signs - Pediatric Normal Ranges:**
- Newborn (0-3 mo): HR 100-180, RR 30-60
- Infant (3-12 mo): HR 100-160, RR 25-50
- Toddler (1-3 yr): HR 80-140, RR 20-30
- Preschool (3-6 yr): HR 70-120, RR 20-25
- School age (6-12 yr): HR 60-100, RR 16-20

**Pediatric Red Flags:**
- Inconsolable crying in infant
- Lethargy or poor feeding in infant
- Fever > 100.4°F (38°C) in infant < 3 months
- Severe dehydration (sunken fontanelle, no tears)
- Respiratory distress with retractions

### Geriatric Considerations

**Modified Assessment:**
- Baseline vital signs may differ
- Atypical presentations common
- Consider baseline cognitive function
- Medication interactions more likely
- Lower threshold for admission

**Geriatric Red Flags:**
- Fall with head strike (anticoagulation concern)
- Acute confusion/delirium
- Weakness or inability to ambulate
- Medication noncompliance
- Social support concerns

## Reassessment Protocol

### Continuous Monitoring
- ESI 1: Continuous monitoring
- ESI 2: Every 15 minutes
- ESI 3: Every 30-60 minutes
- ESI 4-5: At nursing discretion

### Upgrade Criteria
Immediately upgrade if:
- Vital signs deteriorate
- Mental status changes
- New concerning symptoms develop
- Pain significantly worsens

---

## Special Situations

### Pregnancy
- Pregnancy > 20 weeks: ESI 2 or higher
- Vaginal bleeding in pregnancy: ESI 2
- Abdominal pain in pregnancy: ESI 2
- Decreased fetal movement: ESI 2

### Immunocompromised
- Fever in neutropenic patient: ESI 2
- Known immunosuppression with infection: ESI 2-3

### Psychiatric
- Suicidal ideation with plan: ESI 2
- Homicidal ideation: ESI 2
- Acute psychosis: ESI 2-3
- Overdose/ingestion: ESI 2 minimum

### Substance Use
- Intoxication with altered mental status: ESI 2
- Withdrawal with vital sign abnormalities: ESI 2
- Overdose: ESI 1-2 depending on severity

---

## Documentation Requirements

### Minimum Documentation
- Chief complaint
- Vital signs (all: BP, HR, RR, Temp, SpO2, Pain)
- Brief history
- ESI level assigned
- Rationale for level
- Time of assessment
- Reassessment times and findings
- Nurse signature

### Legal Considerations
- Document all red flags identified or ruled out
- Note patient refusal of higher acuity
- Document delays and notification of physician
- Record all communication with patient/family

---

## Quality Metrics

### Accuracy Targets
- ESI 1-2 accuracy: > 95%
- Overall ESI accuracy: > 85%
- Left without being seen (LWBS): < 2%

### Time Targets
- Door to triage: < 5 minutes
- ESI 1: Immediate physician evaluation
- ESI 2: Physician evaluation < 10 minutes
- ESI 3: Physician evaluation < 30 minutes

**IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER**

This protocol provides **guidance only** and does not replace clinical judgment. Each patient must be assessed individually considering their unique circumstances, comorbidities, and presentation. When in doubt, assign a higher acuity level.
