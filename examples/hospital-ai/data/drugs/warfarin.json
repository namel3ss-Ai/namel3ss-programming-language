  "drug_class": "Anticoagulant (Vitamin K Antagonist)",
  
  "mechanism_of_action": "Warfarin inhibits the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, X) and anticoagulant proteins C and S. It interferes with the cyclic interconversion of vitamin K and vitamin K epoxide, reducing the amount of active vitamin K available for the carboxylation of clotting factors.",

  "contraindications": [
    "Pregnancy (Category X - causes fetal harm)",

  "warnings": {
    "black_box": [
      "BLEEDING RISK: Warfarin can cause major or fatal bleeding. Bleeding is more likely during the starting period and with higher doses. Risk factors include high intensity anticoagulation (INR > 4), age ≥ 65, history of GI bleeding, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, serious heart disease, anemia, malignancy, trauma, renal insufficiency, drug-drug interactions, long duration of therapy, and poor anticoagulant control.",
      "Regular monitoring of INR is essential. Dose adjustments must be individualized based on INR response.",
      "PREGNANCY: Warfarin is contraindicated in pregnancy. It crosses the placenta and can cause fatal hemorrhage to the fetus and congenital malformations. Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception."

    "serious": [
      "Calciphylaxis (calcium uremic arteriolopathy) - rare but serious",
      "Acute kidney injury",

      "Skin necrosis (usually appears between days 3-8 of therapy)",
      "Hepatotoxicity"
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Numerous drug and food interactions",
      "Genetic factors affect dosing (CYP2C9 and VKORC1 polymorphisms)",

    "renal_adjustment": "No specific dose adjustment required, but monitor INR more frequently. Increased bleeding risk with renal impairment.",
