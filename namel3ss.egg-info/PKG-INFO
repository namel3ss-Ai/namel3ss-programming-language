# Namel3ss
## The first language designed for AI

> **✨ Now shipping v0.6.1** – [What's new](#whats-new)

We think AI programming should be simple. Beautiful. Intuitive.

So we built a programming language that thinks like you do. Where you describe what you want in plain English, and it creates production applications. Complete with intelligent agents, conversational memory, and sophisticated workflows.

No frameworks to learn. No libraries to wrangle. No boilerplate to write.

**Just pure thought to production code.**

---

Today, developers bolt AI onto languages built for a different era. They wrestle with complexity. Fight with frameworks. Compromise on what's possible.

**We started from zero.**

We asked ourselves: what if AI wasn't an afterthought? What if prompts, memory, agents, and intelligence were as fundamental as variables and functions?

What if building AI applications was as simple as describing them?

## This changes everything

**Intelligent conversations.** Memory isn't an afterthought—it's built into the language. Session memory. Conversation history. Global knowledge. Just declare it.

**Multi-agent systems.** Orchestrate teams of AI agents with simple, declarative syntax. No complex state machines. No imperative choreography. Just describe the workflow.

**Production-ready interfaces.** Navigation, dashboards, real-time data, professional UI components. All generated from your description.

**Your own AI models.** Deploy private LLMs with one command. Full control. Zero external APIs. Enterprise-grade security.

**Type-safe intelligence.** Every prompt has a schema. Every output is validated. Catch errors at compile time, not in production.

**Deterministic testing.** Built-in mocks and stubs. Test AI workflows like any other code. No surprises in production.

And it all compiles to production-ready FastAPI backends and modern React frontends. Fast. Secure. Observable.

## See it in action

Here's a complete AI support system. Written in plain English. Ready for production.

```text
app "AI Support" connects to postgres "SUPPORT_DB".

# Memory as a language construct
memory "chat_history":
  scope: conversation
  kind: conversation
  max_items: 50

# Structured prompts with schemas
prompt "ClassifyTicket":
  input:
    ticket: text
    history: conversation
  output:
    category: one_of("billing", "technical", "general")
    urgency: one_of("low", "medium", "high")
  using model "gpt-4o-mini":
    """
    Classify this support ticket.
    Ticket: {{ticket}}
    History: {{history}}
    """

# Intelligent workflows
define chain "SupportFlow":
  steps:
    - step "classify":
        kind: prompt
        target: ClassifyTicket
        read_memory: chat_history
    - if ctx:steps.classify.result.urgency == "high":
        then:
          - step "escalate": kind: python, module: ops.alerting
        else:
          - step "auto_reply": kind: template, target: AutoReply
    - step "save": write_memory: chat_history

# Professional UI
page "Chat" at "/chat":
  show form "Ask Support":
    fields: message
    on submit:
      run chain SupportFlow with ticket = form.message
      show toast "Your ticket has been processed"
```

That's it. One file. Complete application.

This compiles to:
- Production FastAPI backend with typed validation
- Conversation memory with intelligent scoping
- Conditional workflow orchestration
- Real-time UI components
- Complete test infrastructure

**No frameworks. No glue code. No complexity.**

### Own your AI

Want private, secure AI? Run your own models locally:

```text
model "local_chat" using local_engine:
  engine_type: "ollama" 
  model_name: "llama3.2:latest"
  deployment:
    port: 11434
    gpu_layers: -1

prompt "PrivateChat":
  input: message: text
  output: response: text
  using model "local_chat":
    "You are a helpful assistant. {{message}}"
```

Deploy it. Use it. Own it. All with one command.

```bash
namel3ss deploy local start local_chat
```

No external APIs. No usage limits. Complete control over your AI.

---

## Getting started is insanely simple

### Install Namel3ss

One command. That's all it takes.

```bash
pip install namel3ss
```

The core installation is elegant. Lightweight at ~10MB. Just what you need:
- Language parser and compiler
- FastAPI code generation
- React UI generation  
- CLI tools
- Development server

**Perfect for:** Getting started. Building applications. Shipping to production.

### Add only what you need

We believe in choice. Install just the features you want:

```bash
# AI providers (OpenAI, Claude, local models)
pip install namel3ss[ai]

# Your own private models
pip install namel3ss[local-models]

# Databases
pip install namel3ss[postgres]

# Real-time features
pip install namel3ss[realtime]

# Everything
pip install namel3ss[all]
```

**Or get specific:**

```bash
pip install namel3ss[openai]      # GPT-4 and friends
pip install namel3ss[anthropic]   # Claude
pip install namel3ss[ollama]      # Local Llama, Mistral
pip install namel3ss[vllm]        # High-performance local models
```

Simple. Modular. Your choice.

---

## Your first app in 60 seconds

```bash
# Install
pip install namel3ss

# Create
namel3ss init my-ai-app
cd my-ai-app

# Describe your app
echo 'app "MyApp"
page "home" { 
  show text "Hello, World" 
}' > app.ai

# Build it
namel3ss build app.ai

# Run it
cd out/backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

**Done.** Your app is live at `localhost:8000`.

From thought to running application in 60 seconds.

## What's new

### v0.6.1 (November 2025)

We made RAG development feel magical.

**Tool definitions with parameters.** Define your tools once. Use them everywhere. Type-safe. Self-documenting.

**Agent configurations.** Describe what your agents do. What models they use. What tools they have. The system handles the rest.

**Vector stores.** First-class support for semantic search. pgvector. 1536 dimensions. Cosine similarity. Just declare it.

**Chrome + Tabs.** Build professional interfaces with navigation, tabs, and real-time components. Simple. Beautiful. Fast.

**Smart filtering.** Use `condition:` or `filter_by:`. Whichever reads better. The compiler understands both.

And it all just works. 21+ tests passing. Production-ready. Zero breaking changes.

## Why developers love Namel3ss

### "It just works"

Compared to LangChain or LlamaIndex:
- **It's a language, not a library.** First-class syntax for AI constructs.
- **Compile-time validation.** Catch errors before deployment.
- **Type safety throughout.** Structured inputs and outputs.
- **Deterministic testing.** Built-in mocks. No flaky tests.

### "Finally, AI that makes sense"

Compared to prompt engineering tools:
- **Complete applications.** Not just prompts—full backends and UIs.
- **Integrated memory.** Session, conversation, and global scopes.
- **Multi-agent orchestration.** Declarative graphs. Simple routing.

### "So simple, it's revolutionary"

Compared to traditional web frameworks:
- **AI-native.** Prompts and agents are language primitives.
- **Natural syntax.** Write apps in structured English.
- **Zero boilerplate.** No Flask/FastAPI setup. Routes auto-generated.

---

## Production-ready

**500+ tests.** Language, backend, AI features—all tested.

**Conformance suite.** 71 tests ensuring consistency across implementations.

**Type-safe compilation.** From `.ai` files to production code.

**Observable by default.** OpenTelemetry tracing. Prometheus metrics. Health checks.

**Enterprise features:**
- JWT authentication
- Role-based access control
- Rate limiting
- Distributed tracing
- Horizontal scaling
- Docker deployment
- Kubernetes manifests
